# Competitive Radar

An unofficial work sample showing how I'd run competitive intelligence for Hightouch: the system, its inputs, and what sales receives each week.

**Sample data for illustration. Not real competitive claims.** Company names give category context. Ownership facts in `data/competitors.json` are public and sourced. Every event, rating, and talk track is invented.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Data

Everything the UI shows comes from JSON in `/data`, so swapping sample data for real data never touches the UI.

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `competitors.json` | Competitors, tiers, personas, "why they win" hypotheses, sourced facts |
| `sources.json` | What gets monitored, how often, and what we look for |
| `signal_types.json` | The nine kinds of change the Radar classifies |
| `rules.json` | Deal-impact scoring, urgency, confidence, routing table |
| `signals.json` | Scored signals across three weeks |
| `digest.json` | This week's top-3, trends, and win-loss questions |
| `battlecard_segment.json` | Sample battlecard |
| `matrix.json` | Capability matrix and positioning map |
| `routing_log.json` | Where intel went, plus the KPI scorecard |

`samples/snapshots/` holds before/after source snapshots that power the diff demo.

Run `npm run check:data` after editing data. It validates enum fields and every cross-file reference.

## Deploy

Import the repo in Vercel (framework preset: Next.js). The site is `noindex` and blocked in `robots.txt`, so it's shared by link only.

## The pipeline (`scripts/radar.py`)

The site shows the Radar's output. `scripts/radar.py` shows how the output gets made:

1. **Fetch** each public source in `data/sources.json` (`--live`; sources with placeholder URLs are skipped).
2. **Snapshot** it to a dated file.
3. **Diff** against the previous snapshot. Date stamps and edits of 2 words or fewer are dropped as cosmetic, the same rule the site's diff demo uses. Each changed line keeps its section heading, so "moved from Add-ons to Starter" survives the diff.
4. **Classify** each meaningful diff with the Claude API. A JSON schema built from `signal_types.json` and `rules.json` makes the response match the `signals.json` shape exactly. Urgency is computed in code from the rules, not by the model.
5. **Write drafts** to `samples/output/signals.generated.json` with status "In review". A person checks every draft before it moves into `data/signals.json` and onto the site.

```bash
python3 scripts/radar.py --dry-run          # diff the sample snapshots, no API call
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...                # or `ant auth login`
python3 scripts/radar.py                    # diff + classify the sample snapshots
```

### Running it weekly

In production this runs on a schedule, for example a GitHub Actions cron early every Monday, before the digest goes out:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 13 * * 1"   # Mondays 13:00 UTC (5 or 6am Pacific)
jobs:
  radar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
      - run: python3 scripts/radar.py --live
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      # Open a PR with the drafts. Approving and merging it is the human review step.
      - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6
        with:
          title: "Radar drafts for review"
          add-paths: samples/output/
```

Pricing pages would get a second, daily job. Internal sources (win-loss notes, Gong mentions) come from their own exports and go through the same classify-and-review step.
